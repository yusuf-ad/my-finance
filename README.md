# My Finance App üìù

Personal Finance App is a modern full-stack web application developed as part of a challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/personal-finance-app-JfjtZgyMt1). The app provides an intuitive platform for users to manage their budgets by categorizing expenses as negative and incomes as positive values, ensuring a clear and efficient financial overview. Through this project, I learned how to effectively use Next.js Server Actions, implement caching, and manage loading states in Next.js.

## Key Features üóùÔ∏è

- **Expense and Income Management**: Record expenses as negative values and
  incomes as positive values for easy budget tracking.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed to provide a seamless user experience
  with an intuitive and responsive UI.
- **Secure and Scalable**: Built with performance and security in mind, ensuring
  user data is safe.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all devices, ensuring a seamless experience
  on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Pagination**: Easily navigate through your transactions and budgets with intuitive
  pagination controls, making data management efficient and organized.
- **Loading States**: Enhance user experience with loading indicators and skeleton
  screens during data fetching, ensuring smooth and uninterrupted interactions.
- **Caching Mechanism**: Improve performance and reduce load times with effective
  caching strategies, providing faster access to your financial data.
